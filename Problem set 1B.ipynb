If the process is successful, no one but the intended recipient can understand the encrypted message. Cryptanalysis refers to attempts to undo the encryption, even if some details of the encryption areunknown (for example, if an encrypted message has been intercepted). The first step of cryptanalysis is often to build up a table of letter frequencies in the encrypted text.Assume that the string letters is already defined as'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Write a function called frequencies()that takes a string as its only parameter, and returns a list of integers, showing thenumber of times each character appears in the text.
